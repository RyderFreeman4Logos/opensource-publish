# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to a work published using the opensource-publish template ("the Work"). This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing.

By submitting a contribution to the author or maintainers of the Work ("the Author"), you ("the Contributor") agree to the following terms:

**1. Definitions**

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by you for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Work. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Author or their representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Author for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

"Work" means the literary, artistic, or scientific work owned by the Author to which you are contributing. The Work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license, or a similar license that restricts the creation and distribution of derivative works.

**2. Grant of Copyright License**

You hereby grant to the Author and to recipients of the Work distributed by the Author a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

This license allows the Author to incorporate your Contribution into the Work. The Author may then continue to distribute the Work, including your Contribution, under the terms of the Work's original license (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

**3. Grant of Patent License**

You hereby grant to the Author and to recipients of the Work distributed by the Author a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

**4. Representations and Warranties**

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Author.

You represent that each of your Contributions is your own original creation. You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

**5. Disclaimer**

Your Contributions are provided "AS IS," without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**6. Clarification on the Work's License**

This Agreement does not grant you any rights in or to the Work itself. Your right to use, copy, or distribute the Work is governed entirely by the terms of the license under which the Work is published (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). This Agreement solely pertains to the rights you grant to the Author for your specific Contributions. You are not permitted to create or distribute derivative versions of the Work.
